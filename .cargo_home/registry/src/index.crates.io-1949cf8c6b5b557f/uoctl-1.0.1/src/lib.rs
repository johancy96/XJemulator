//! `ioctl`s for Linux APIs.
//!
//! This library provides a convenient way to bind to Linux `ioctl`s.
//!
//! It is intended to help with writing wrappers around driver functionality, and tries to mirror
//! the syntax you'll find in C headers closely.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Let's wrap V4L2's `QUERYCAP` ioctl.
//!
//! From `linux/videodev2.h`:
//!
//! ```c
//! struct v4l2_capability {
//! 	__u8	driver[16];
//! 	__u8	card[32];
//! 	__u8	bus_info[32];
//! 	__u32   version;
//! 	__u32	capabilities;
//! 	__u32	device_caps;
//! 	__u32	reserved[3];
//! };
//! // ...
//! #define VIDIOC_QUERYCAP		 _IOR('V',  0, struct v4l2_capability)
//! ```
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
//! use uoctl::*;
//!
//! #[repr(C)]
//! struct Capability {
//!     driver: [u8; 16],
//!     card: [u8; 32],
//!     bus_info: [u8; 32],
//!     version: u32,
//!     capabilities: u32,
//!     device_caps: u32,
//!     reserved: [u32; 3],
//! }
//!
//! const VIDIOC_QUERYCAP: Ioctl<*mut Capability> = _IOR(b'V', 0);
//!
//! // Use as follows:
//!
//! # let fd = 123;
//! let capability = unsafe {
//!     let mut capability = MaybeUninit::uninit();
//!     VIDIOC_QUERYCAP.ioctl(&fd, capability.as_mut_ptr())?;
//!     capability.assume_init()
//! };
//! # std::io::Result::Ok(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! Despite being about Linux APIs, and following the Linux convention for declaring `ioctl` codes,
//! this library should also work on other operating systems that implement a Linux-comparible
//! `ioctl`-based API.
//!
//! For example, FreeBSD implements a variety of compatible interfaces like *evdev* and *V4L2*.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! To safely perform an `ioctl`, the actual behavior of the kernel-side has to match the behavior
//! expected by userspace (which is encoded in the [`Ioctl`] type).
//!
//! To accomplish this, it is necessary that the [`Ioctl`] was constructed correctly by the caller:
//! the direction, type, number, and argument type size are used to build the ioctl request code,
//! and the Rust type used as the ioctl argument has to match what the kernel expects.
//! If the argument is a pointer the kernel will read from or write to, the data behind the pointer
//! also has to be valid, of course (`ioctl`s are arbitrary functions, so the same care is needed
//! as when binding to an arbitrary C function).
//!
//! However, this is not, strictly speaking, *sufficient* to ensure safety:
//! several drivers and subsystems share the same `ioctl` "type" value, which may lead to an ioctl
//! request code that is interpreted differently, depending on which driver receives the request.
//! Since the `ioctl` request code encodes the size of the argument type, this operation is unlikely
//! to cause a fault when accessing memory, since both argument types have the same size, so the
//! `ioctl` syscall may complete successfully instead of returning `EFAULT`.
//!
//! The result of this situation is that a type intended for data from one driver now has data from
//! an entirely unrelated driver in it, which will likely cause UB, either because a *validity
//! invariant* was violated by the data written to the structure, or because userspace will trust
//! the kernel to only write valid data (including pointers) to the structure.
//!
//! While it may technically be possible to tell which driver owns a given device file descriptor
//! by crawling `/sys` or querying `udev`, in practice this situation is deemed "sufficiently
//! unlikely to cause problems" and programs don't bother with this.
//!
//! One way to rule out this issue is to prevent arbitrary file descriptors from making their way
//! to the ioctl, and to ensure that only files that match the driver's naming convention are used
//! for these ioctls.
//! For example, an *evdev* wrapper could refuse to operate on files outside of `/dev/input`, and a
//! KVM API could always open `/dev/kvm` without offering a safe API to act on a different device
//! file.
//!
//! For more information, you can look at the list of ioctl groups here:
//! <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/ioctl/ioctl-number.html>
//!
//! ***TL;DR**: don't worry about it kitten :)*
